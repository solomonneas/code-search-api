Code Search API indexes your codebase, stores local embeddings in SQLite, and lets you search by intent instead of exact text. It is built for agents, developer dashboards, and CLI workflows that need fast answers across real repositories.

Embeddings run locally through Ollama by default. Summaries can run locally too, or use Ollama Cloud models when you want better code explanations without wiring up another model provider.

## What It Does

- Splits source files with language-aware chunking instead of arbitrary line windows
- Embeds chunks with Ollama and stores packed float32 vectors in SQLite
- Generates optional LLM summaries per chunk for higher-quality intent search
- Searches code vectors, summary vectors, or a weighted hybrid of both
- Exposes a small FastAPI service for local tools and agent workflows

## How It Works

```

1. **Chunking**: Files are split at logical boundaries (function/class definitions, not arbitrary line counts). Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Markdown, and config files are all handled with language-specific patterns.

2. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded with your chosen Ollama model and stored as packed float32 BLOBs in SQLite. No vector database required.

3. **Summarization**: An LLM generates a 1-2 sentence summary per chunk describing what the code *does*, not just what it *contains*. The summary gets its own embedding vector.

4. **Hybrid search**: Queries match against both code embeddings (35% weight) and summary embeddings (65% weight). This means searching "authentication flow" finds auth code even if the word "authentication" never appears in variable names.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solomonneas/code-search-api.git
cd code-search-api
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # edit CODE_SEARCH_WORKSPACE to point at your repos
```

Pull an embedding model and start Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:8b
```

Index your code, then start the server:

```bash
source .env
python3 run-index.py                          # first-time index
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5204
```

Search:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5204/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "rate limiting middleware", "mode": "hybrid"}'
```

## Embedding Models

The embedding model is the most important choice. It determines search quality.

**Recommended: `qwen3-embedding:8b`** (what this project was built on)

| Model | Params | VRAM | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|-------|--------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **qwen3-embedding:8b** | 8B | ~6 GB | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | Best overall. Strong code + multilingual understanding. **Recommended.** |
| qwen3-embedding:4b | 4B | ~3 GB | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | Good balance if VRAM is tight |
| qwen3-embedding:0.6b | 0.6B | ~500 MB | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | Laptop/low-resource environments |
| nomic-embed-text | 137M | ~300 MB | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | Lightweight, fast, proven. Good starter model. |
| mxbai-embed-large | 335M | ~700 MB | ★★★½☆ | ★★★★☆ | Strong English performance |
| bge-m3 | 567M | ~1 GB | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | Excellent multilingual support |
| snowflake-arctic-embed2 | 568M | ~1 GB | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | Strong multilingual, good scaling |
| nomic-embed-text-v2-moe | MoE | ~500 MB | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | Multilingual MoE, efficient |

Pull your chosen model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:8b    # recommended
# or
ollama pull nomic-embed-text      # lightweight alternative
```

Set it in `.env`:

```
CODE_SEARCH_EMBED_MODEL=qwen3-embedding:8b
```

> **Note:** Changing the embedding model after indexing requires a full re-index since vector dimensions and similarity spaces differ between models.

## Summary Models

Summaries are what make hybrid search work. The summarizer reads each code chunk and writes a 1-2 sentence description of what it *does*. That summary gets its own embedding, so you can find code by describing behavior.

**Be realistic about model quality here.** A tiny quantized local model will produce vague, useless summaries like "This file contains code." That defeats the purpose. You need a model that can actually read code and explain it.

### If you have Ollama Pro (cloud models via Ollama)

Best option for bulk code-search summaries. Our April 2026 code-search gauntlet still put `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` first, with `kimi-k2.6:cloud` as the best tested fallback.

| Model | Quality | Speed | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| **qwen3-coder-next:cloud** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | Current default. Best balance of clean summaries, speed, and structure. |
| kimi-k2.6:cloud | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | Best tested fallback. Strong identifier retention, but more verbose. |
| gemma4:31b-cloud | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | Clean outputs, but lower key-term retention and severe tail latency on code-search summaries. |
| deepseek-v4-flash:cloud | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | Promising candidate, but needs thinking behavior controlled and had worse tail latency. |
| deepseek-v4-pro:cloud | ★★☆☆☆ | ★☆☆☆☆ | Clean when successful, but rejected for bulk summaries after 7/100 failures, two 180s timeouts, and severe tail latency. |
| deepseek-v3.2:cloud | ★★★☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | Reliable, but slower and lower retention in our backfill gauntlet. |
| minimax-m2.7:cloud | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | Reject for summaries. Too much empty-content or thinking leakage in this workflow. |

Recent gauntlet results on the same 100 real code/documentation chunks:

| Model | Success | Median | P95 | Key retention | Decision |
|-------|--------:|-------:|----:|--------------:|----------|
| `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` | 100/100 | 1.64s | 3.01s | 0.293 | Primary |
| `kimi-k2.6:cloud` | 100/100 | 2.59s | 4.76s | 0.296 | Fallback |
| `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` | 100/100 | 1.88s | 14.41s | 0.288 | Candidate only |
| `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` | 93/100 | 2.29s | 56.24s | 0.218 | Reject |
| `gemma4:31b-cloud` | 100/100 | 2.16s | 31.11s | 0.247 | Reject |

DeepSeek V4 Pro looked clean when it returned, but the April 28 run had five HTTP 503s, two 180s timeouts, lower identifier retention, and a much worse latency tail than Qwen or Kimi. Do not route bulk summary backfills to it unless a future retry shows materially better reliability.

Ollama Pro supports two auth paths:

- Local CLI and localhost API calls can use `ollama signin`.
- Direct hosted calls to `https://ollama.com/api` use `OLLAMA_API_KEY`.

Ollama Pro is a $20/month plan with 3 concurrent cloud models and 50x more cloud usage than Free. Ollama documents cloud usage as infrastructure utilization rather than a fixed token cap, with session limits resetting every 5 hours and weekly limits resetting every 7 days.

### If running local models only

You need at least a 14B+ parameter model to get useful code summaries. Anything smaller will hallucinate function names and produce generic descriptions that don't help search.

| Model | Params | VRAM | Quality | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|---------|-------|
| qwen3:32b | 32B | ~20 GB | ★★★★☆ | Best local option if you have the VRAM |
| qwen3:14b | 14B | ~10 GB | ★★★½☆ | Minimum viable for code summaries |
| codellama:34b | 34B | ~22 GB | ★★★★☆ | Strong code understanding |
| deepseek-coder-v2:16b | 16B | ~11 GB | ★★★½☆ | Decent code summaries |

**Models to avoid for summarization:**

| Model | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Any model < 7B | Summaries will be too vague to improve search |
| Heavily quantized (Q2, Q3) | Quality degrades to the point of being worse than no summary |
| Embedding models | These can't generate text, only vectors |

Set your summary model in `.env`:

```
CODE_SEARCH_SUMMARY_MODEL=qwen3-coder-next:cloud    # Ollama Pro
CODE_SEARCH_SUMMARY_FALLBACK=kimi-k2.6:cloud        # optional cloud fallback
# or
CODE_SEARCH_SUMMARY_MODEL=qwen3:32b                  # local, needs ~20GB VRAM
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |

| `GET` | `/health` | No | Liveness check |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | No | Health + index stats (chunks, embedded, summarized) |
| `POST` | `/api/search` | Yes | Semantic search with hybrid, code, or summary mode |
| `POST` | `/api/index` | Yes | Trigger background indexing run |
| `POST` | `/api/backfill-summaries` | Yes | Generate summaries for unsummarized chunks |
| `GET` | `/api/projects` | Yes | Per-project chunk and summary counts |
| `GET` | `/api/stats` | No | Chunk type breakdown and project coverage |

### Search request

```json
{
  "query": "websocket authentication middleware",
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "limit": 10,
  "min_score": 0.3,
  "project": "my-api"
}
```

**Modes:**
- `hybrid` (default): Weighted combination of code + summary similarity. Best for most searches.
- `code`: Raw code embedding match only. Use when searching for exact patterns.
- `summary`: Summary embedding match only. Use when searching by high-level intent.
